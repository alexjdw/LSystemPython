Create fractals in python using pygame

The first and last fractal do not work like I am expecting them to so if you find something, please make an edit. Thank you
I am relatively new to programming. I really love fractals and tried to apply my recently gained knowledge to this program. Please let me know what I can change to improve efficiency or bad habits which you see.
